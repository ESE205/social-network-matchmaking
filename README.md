# social-network-matchmaking

Main branch contains android project directory

The NodeJS branch contains the nodeJS server files. Note that this will not properly compile unless a neo4j.js file is added to the routes that includes a url, username, and password for the neo4j server

Other branches include android projects I completed in preparation for building this app


Note that the main branch might not compile unless a network.xml file is added under the res/values directory. This file should just contain the server url information.
