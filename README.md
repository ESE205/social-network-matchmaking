# social-network-matchmaking

This is a github repo for my Spring 2019 project for ESE 205. 

https://classes.engineering.wustl.edu/ese205/core/index.php?title=Social_Network_Matchmaking#Design_and_Solutions

Master branch contains android project directory

Note that the master branch might not compile unless a network.xml file is added under the res/values directory. This file should just contain the server url information.

The NodeJS branch contains the nodeJS server files. Note that this will not properly compile unless a neo4j.js file is added to the routes that includes a url, username, and password for the neo4j server

Other branches include android projects I completed in preparation for building this app
